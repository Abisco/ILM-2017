# ILM-2017
Project for ILM 2017 (Unofficial name)

## About ILM-2017
A Video Sharing website akin to Udemy, this website was made for the http://www.goilm.ca competition (like a hackathon, but more focused on the actual idea). A total of 8 hours was used on making and editing the website, as such, only the front end has been developed using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript.

You can checkout the front-end design with some basic buttons to press (example, try logging in). Not everything works, and some things are just images.
